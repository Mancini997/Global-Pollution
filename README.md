# Project: Finding Relations Between Pollution and Population

## Overview

This project aims to explore the relationships between population metrics, population density, territory, and various pollution factors such as AQI (Air Quality Index), PM2.5, PM10, and Ozone levels. The analysis involves sourcing datasets from Kaggle, setting up a SQL database for initial data analysis, and generating visualizations using Python for presentation purposes.

## Process

**Data Sourcing**: The datasets were sourced from Kaggle, focusing on population metrics, pollution levels (AQI, PM2.5, PM10, Ozone), and related geographical information.

**Database Setup**: Using MySQL, a database was created to store and analyze the datasets. SQL queries were used to perform initial data exploration, aggregation, and filtering.

**Data Analysis**: 
   - SQL queries were utilized to calculate population density and analyze pollution metrics per country.
   - Python with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries were used to further analyze the data and create visualizations.
   
**Visualization**: 
   - Various plots such as bar plots, scatter plots, and box plots were generated to visualize relationships between population density, pollution metrics, and other variables.
   - Seaborn and matplotlib were employed to create visually appealing and informative plots.
   
 **Findings**: 
   - Correlation analyses were conducted to determine if there are significant relationships between population density and pollution levels.
   - The visualizations and findings were compiled into a presentation format suitable for stakeholders and decision-makers.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL (MySQL)**: For database setup, data querying, and initial analysis.
- **Python**: Utilized pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
- **GitHub**: Repository hosted on GitHub for version control and collaboration.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for interactive data exploration and analysis.

## Project Structure
