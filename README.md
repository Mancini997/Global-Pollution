Project: Air Pollution and Population Analysis
Datasets
Global Air Pollution Dataset: This dataset contains information about air pollution levels in various countries. A suitable Kaggle dataset is Global Air Pollution Dataset.
World Population Dataset: This dataset contains information about the population of different countries over several years. A suitable Kaggle dataset is World Population by Country.

Set Up the Database

Create a new database called AirPollutionPopulationDB.

Create Tables

AirPollution Table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE AirPollution (
    country VARCHAR(100),
    year INT,
    pm25 FLOAT,
    pm10 FLOAT,
    no2 FLOAT,
    o3 FLOAT,
    PRIMARY KEY (country, year)
);
Population Table:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Population (
    country VARCHAR(100),
    year INT,
    population INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (country, year)
);
Insert Data into Tables

Load the data from the CSV files into the tables. You can use a tool like pandas in Python to read the CSV files and insert the data into the SQL tables.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('AirPollutionPopulationDB.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Load Air Pollution data
air_pollution_df = pd.read_csv('global_air_pollution.csv')
air_pollution_df.to_sql('AirPollution', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)

# Load Population data
population_df = pd.read_csv('population_by_country.csv')
population_df.to_sql('Population', conn, if_exists='replace', index=False)

# Commit and close connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()
Basic SQL Queries

Select all air pollution data:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM AirPollution;
Select population data for a specific year:

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM Population WHERE year = 2020;
Join Queries

Find the average PM2.5 level by country:

sql
Copy code
SELECT country, AVG(pm25) AS avg_pm25
FROM AirPollution
GROUP BY country;
Find the total population for a specific country over the years:

sql
Copy code
SELECT country, SUM(population) AS total_population
FROM Population
GROUP BY country;
Advanced Queries

Find the top 10 countries with the highest PM2.5 levels in a specific year:

sql
Copy code
SELECT country, pm25
FROM AirPollution
WHERE year = 2020
ORDER BY pm25 DESC
LIMIT 10;
Find the country with the highest population in a specific year:

sql
Copy code
SELECT country, population
FROM Population
WHERE year = 2020
ORDER BY population DESC
LIMIT 1;
Correlate air pollution levels with population data:

sql
Copy code
SELECT p.country, p.year, p.population, a.pm25
FROM Population p
LEFT JOIN AirPollution a ON p.country = a.country AND p.year = a.year;
Find the correlation between population and PM2.5 levels:

sql
Copy code
SELECT p.year, p.country, p.population, a.pm25
FROM Population p
JOIN AirPollution a ON p.country = a.country AND p.year = a.year
WHERE a.pm25 IS NOT NULL;
Deliverables
SQL Script: A script that creates the database, tables, and inserts sample data.
Query Results: Results of the sample queries and advanced queries.
This project will help you practice creating and managing databases, understanding relationships between tables, and performing various types of SQL queries with a combination of air pollution data and population data.
